# [GitHub Résumé](https://resume.github.io/)

**A service that creates a résumé based on your GitHub repos/activity.**

The official GitHub Résumé is **opt-in**. This fork removes the opt-in check so you can view any user's résumé.

Great for all the tech-savy bosses who want to have a **quick view** of person's git/github activity, _before the interview_.

### Development

To run the app in development mode:

    $ rackup config.ru

(You must have Ruby and the rack gem installed.)
